Mancala is a family of board games played around the world, sometimes called "sowing" games, or "count-and-capture" games, which describes the gameplay. The word mancala (منقلة) comes from the Arabic word naqala (نقلة) meaning literally "to move".[1][2][3] No one game exists with the name mancala; the name is a classification or type of game. This word is used in Syria, Lebanon, and Egypt, but is not consistently applied to any one game.

The word mancala can also be found in the Akan. The name describes the type of games played with this instrument, not a specific game played with it. There are many variations to the game with different names.

More than 800 names of traditional mancala games are known, and almost 200 invented games have been described. However, some names denote the same game, while some names are used for more than one game.
