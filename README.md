# MochiMochi Mancala-Game
First Project
Mancala is a family of board games played around the world, sometimes called "sowing" games, or "count-and-capture" games, which describes the gameplay. The word mancala (منقلة) comes from the Arabic word naqala (نقلة) meaning literally "to move".[1][2][3] No one game exists with the name mancala; the name is a classification or type of game. This word is used in Syria, Lebanon, and Egypt, but is not consistently applied to any one game.

The word mancala can also be found in the Akan. The name describes the type of games played with this instrument, not a specific game played with it. There are many variations to the game with different names.

More than 800 names of traditional mancala games are known, and almost 200 invented games have been described. However, some names denote the same game, while some names are used for more than one game.

INSTRUCTIONS
Your goal is to get more gems into your mancala (the cup on the right) than the computer can get into its mancala (on the left).
You get to start, then the computer takes its turn and so on.

The Mancala 'board' is made up of two rows of six pit s, each.

1) You can only move gems on your side (which is the bottom row).
2) To move, you click on one of the cups in your row. This picks up all the pieces in that cup and moves them counter-clockwise, putting one gem in each cup. (You'll see!)
3) If the last gem of your move lands in your mancala, you get to go again.
4) If the last gem of your move lands in an empty cup on your side and there are gems in the computer's cup right across from it, then all the gems in both cups get put into your mancala.
